  Scenario: As a user I can interact and assert on input validation
    Given I am on the "home" page
    And I click the "playground" button
    When I am directed to the "playground" page
    And the "validation label" should contain the text "Error"
    And the "validation label" should not contain the text "Errors"
    And the "validation error" should contain the text "Incorrect entry."
